Commit: 2d520ab Merge branch 'more-course-parameters' into integration
----------------

Deprecation Warnings:

Using `stub` from rspec-mocks' old `:should` syntax without explicitly enabling the syntax is deprecated. Use the new `:expect` syntax or explicitly enable `:should` instead. Called from /home/tmc/tmc-server/spec/support/remote_sandbox_for_testing.rb:38:in `init_stubs!'.


If you need more of the backtrace for any of these deprecations to
identify where to make the necessary changes, you can configure
`config.raise_errors_for_deprecations!`, and it will turn the
deprecation warnings into errors, giving you the full backtrace.
